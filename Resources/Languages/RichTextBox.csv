rbx_CustomRulesExplanation,"This is an advanced feature. AdminName1-4 & ToponymName refer to the API outputs so if you don't understand that, probably don't poke this at all. 
Re: ""Predetermined countries"" (checkbox below): Read about those here: https://github.com/nemethviktor/GeoTagNinja/issues/38#issuecomment-1356844255 + check the other tab - Note if you disable that setting it then will blank CountryCode cells that fall outside the relevant grouping but won't actually drop those rows.
All columns are compulsory exc for ""Custom"" but if you set the Outcome to ""Custom"" and leave the ""Custom"" col empty the row will be ignored. Data is not-case-sensitive. For each datapoint (e.g. City, State) the last row overwrites the previous ones. Basically be sensible. The more rows you add the slower it will get.
Example: the default data return from the API for London UK is poor because for that particular region adminName2 = ""Greater London"", and it'd be discarded as such (cities are usually from ""ToponymName""). -> set: ""what"" = ""adminName2"", ""if"" = ""is"", ""Condition Value"" = ""Greater London"", ""then"" = ""City"", ""becomes"" = ""adminName2"". Repeat the whole thing in a 2nd row but ""then"" = ""Sub_Loction"" and ""becomes"" = ""ToponymName"".",
